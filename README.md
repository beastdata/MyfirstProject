The Student Management System project:

What the project does
This is a simple computer program that helps schools keep track of their students' information. It can:
- Add new students (name, roll number, age, and marks)
- Show all students' information in a neat table
- Save all information to a file so it's not lost when you close the program
- Load saved information when you start the program again

Why the project is useful
- Schools can stop using paper records that can get lost or damaged
- Teachers can quickly add and view student information
- All student data is stored safely in one place
- It's faster than writing everything by hand
- You can't accidentally lose information since it's saved in a file

How to get started
1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer (like GCC)
2. Download the project files
3. Compile the program using: `gcc student_management.c -o student_management`
4. Run the program: `./student_management`
5. You'll see a simple menu with these options:
   - Press 1 to add a new student
   - Press 2 to see all students
   - Press 3 to save to file
   - Press 4 to exit

Where to get help
If you need help with the program:
- Check the comments in the code - they explain how each part works
- Read the project report for detailed explanations
- Common issues and solutions:
  - If names with spaces don't work, make sure to use quotes when typing them
  - If the file won't save, check if you have write permissions in the folder
  - If the display looks messy, try using shorter names
